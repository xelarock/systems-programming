Projects for CS 350 - Systems Programming at Emory University

This is Lab0, the ppmcvt program. Overall this was a good project that I did enjoy. It was challenging in that i did have to struggle to get things working, but I think it was a good amount of struggle. I think it was good to get thrown in the deep end with C programming by doing this project. One thing i will say that did make it challenging was that the specification could have been a bit more well defined. The specs and program were constantly being updated througout the week so that made it a bit challenging to make my program fit. I would write something, only to see that the specs added some more requirements. I think by then end, the specs were more well defined, i just wish it was like that from the start of the project. 

Some other comments that I wanted to make. For some commands with mutiple errors, I returned the first error I processed, which in some cases was different then the first error that Dr. Arnold's program encountered. I hope this will suffice as I did catch one of the many errors for a certain command.
